# Readme 
This repository contains the Dariel Salties submission for the 2023 O'Reilly Road Warrior Kata.  

The repository is structured as follows:

# [Context](./Context.md)

This section provides an overview of our understanding of Road Warrior and its requirements, as well as our analysis of architecture characteristics and the architecture principles that we chose to guide our approach.

# [User Stories](./User Stories.md)

This section provides a breakdown of user stories and events. It is intended to provider the reader with a view of the functionality that we expect from Road Warrior.  We also include a breakdown of events and a few examples of process flows.

# [Architecture Decision Records](./Architecture Decision Records.md)

This section provides a record of our architecture decisions.

# [Architecture](./Architecture.md)

This section illustrates the actual architecture that we've defined for Road Warrior - starting with a high-level architecture that shows a number of purpose-specific subsystems, as well as the inner workings of each of those subsystems.
