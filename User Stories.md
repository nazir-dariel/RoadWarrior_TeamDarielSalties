# Requirements and Flows 
We broke down functional system requirements as user stories**. The users (or actors) that we identified include: travellers, administrators, support users, travel agents, and data buyers**.

As we discussed the stories, we also identified events that would be triggered within the Road Warrior solution**. Some of the key user stories and events are summarized below, as well As a **small subset of flows that we used to understand how the solution can be structured to best support the users' needs**.
